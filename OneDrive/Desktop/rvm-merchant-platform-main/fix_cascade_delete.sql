-- Fix: Add CASCADE delete to submission_reviews table
-- This will automatically delete related reviews when a merchant is deleted

-- Drop existing foreign key constraint
ALTER TABLE submission_reviews 
DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS submission_reviews_merchant_id_fkey;

-- Add new constraint with CASCADE delete
ALTER TABLE submission_reviews 
ADD CONSTRAINT submission_reviews_merchant_id_fkey 
FOREIGN KEY (merchant_id) 
REFERENCES merchants(id) 
ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- Verify the constraint was added
